üìù veilcy-cloner is a selfbot designed to clone Discord servers. It allows users to create a complete replica of a Discord server, including channels, roles, categories, permissions, and settings, onto a new or existing Discord server. This tool is intended for users who want to quickly and efficiently migrate a server structure or create backup copies for security or testing purposes.

This selfbot leverages the Discord API through the discord.js library to interact with the Discord platform.  It automates the tedious process of manually recreating a server's infrastructure. It efficiently handles large servers with complex permission structures. The cloner is designed to be customizable, allowing users to tailor the cloning process to their specific needs and preferences. This project is best suited for experienced Discord users and developers who understand the implications of using selfbots and are aware of Discord's Terms of Service regarding automation.

The primary goal of veilcy-cloner is to provide a streamlined and reliable solution for server duplication. It simplifies the server management process by offering a one-click cloning option, saving significant time and effort. Keep in mind that using selfbots can violate Discord's Terms of Service, so use this tool at your own risk and discretion. The developers are not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of this selfbot.

‚ú® Key Features

*   **Full Server Cloning:** Clones all channels (text, voice, category), roles, permissions, emoji and server settings from the source server to the target server. This includes channel topics, role names, and server descriptions.
*   **Role Recreation:** Accurately recreates all roles from the original server, including their permissions, color, and name. This ensures the cloned server retains the same role hierarchy as the original.
*   **Channel and Category Recreation:** Replicates the entire channel structure, including categories and all channels within them. This preserves the organizational layout of the original server.
*   **Permission Synchronization:** Copies all channel and role permissions, ensuring that users have the same access levels in the cloned server as they did in the original server. This ensures that the new server functions identically to the original regarding user access.
*   **Customizable Options:** Allows users to configure the cloning process through environment variables, allowing for tailored cloning based on user preferences and specific requirements.
*   **Message Handling:** Implements intelligent message handling to avoid rate limits and ensure smooth cloning operation.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Provides comprehensive logging information throughout the cloning process, allowing users to track progress, identify errors, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
